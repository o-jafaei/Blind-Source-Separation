Main Files to run are:

	1- MIM_natural_and_SD_kernel.m
	2- MIM_natural_and_SD_poly.m.


The first half of these two files contains implementations of natural gradient descent, while the second half delves into the implementation of the normal steepest descent gradient
To run these two files, all other .m files are needed. They are necessary.
